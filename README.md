### Goal of the application and value to the user
The application is used as an online voting system where candidates and their personal information are displayed, and users can easily vote for said candidates. There are various filtering and sorting options so users can narrow down the information. There is a button to add as well as remove votes. The online version of voting makes it much easier for users to vote, and assess who they are voting for.

### Organization of Components
States were used in the creation of each button that was used. The state would need to updated upon the button being prssed. The sort button involved the change of the organization of the cards. The voting buttons involved the incrementation of a number, or the subtraction. The checkboxes and sort utilized components and props. For both checkbox and sortbutton, both objects were created and stored in their own files, and then called when needed. 

### Button sizes were ensured to be large enough to be easily seen and clicked on the the user. The sort buttons are separated by category and labelled so it is intuitive for the user on how to use them. The information on each candidate is clearly displayed in its own category. Sorting and filtering buttons are on the top of the page, easiest for the user to access.
